This is a short-_ish_ history of the projects I worked on while I was in the games industry.

Some got canceled, some were released. All of them helped me paint a clear picture of software development and how to build experiences for people.

So here it is, from Nokia Series 60 to PlayStation 3:

* 2015 [Curse of Mermos](05-CME.md)
* 2012 [World of Mercenaries](04-WOM.md)
* 2011 [Assassin's Creed: Revelations](03-ACR.md)
* 2010 [Treasure Hunters Institute](02-THI.md)
* 2006 [AMA Games](01-AMA.md)
