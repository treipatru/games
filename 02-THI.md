### About Project

Treasure Hunters Institute (THI) was a F2P online adventure game aimed at challenging the mind with puzzles and riddles in a huge open-world environment. The first two worlds available were the ruins of ancient Egypt and the hidden jungles of Peru.

The experience was not story-driven, instead it was focused on world exploration and discrete quests which the player would choose to follow. The game would be released with a substantial amount of quests for player to finish, however the strong point was the quest creator and therefore the content published by players.

Since it was a bigger project with a lot more people involved my tasks were more focused than in mobile games. I worked on content creation tools for players to make their own game quests (UGC), designed character creation and customization systems as well as leveling and reward systems. Apart from that I was also heavily involved in designing UI controls and menu flows as well as the online (website) components of the game.
